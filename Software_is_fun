Writing software is enjoyable. Any developer can attest to this truth if you ask them why they are compelled to lead a life of programming. Professionals, enthusiasts, students, and even casual coders all engage in software application development because they find it to be fundamentally very pleasurable.

Because they enjoy solving problems, engineers enjoy programming. They are drawn to the task of constructing, repairing, and improving things in order to improve and make safer our lives and the world. As opposed to many other artisans, they typically develop a strong affinity with the systems, platforms, and tools they use. However, like any marriage, this partnership might go through growing pains.
